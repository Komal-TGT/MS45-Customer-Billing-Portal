# MS45 â€“ Customer Billing & Usage Portal (Self-Service)

A customer-facing portal that lets your users:

- View current usage and remaining balance
- Download invoices
- Top-up or upgrade plans
- Regenerate API keys
- Manage billing information & IP allowlist

This portal lives under your Admin Panel domain but is customer-facing.  
Built with *Next.js* (frontend) + *Node.js API (BFF)* and integrates with:

- *MS1* (Authentication via Azure AD B2C or magic link)
- *MS32* (Usage data + key regeneration)
- *MS10* (Invoices / Payments)
- *MS9* (Emails for magic links / notifications)
